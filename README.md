# Home Networking Project

## Problem

The old topology consisted of the standard home setup of a Netgear modem and router. There were issues where the router would receive occasional pings from companies and misread them as DOS attacks which caused a temporary disruption in internet conectivity. Netgear's router software does not provide any options to modify the firewall's sensitivity which led to the following solution.

## Solution
A new router was purchased from Netgate that came with pfsense pre-installed. Pfsense is more versatile than retail firewall/router software and provides a lot of customization to tailor network security to the specific situation. In addition, a network swtich was purchased to integrate the new equipment. The old Netgear router would be repurposed as a wireless access point.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools & Equipment Used

- Pfsense 
- Network switch
- Modem
- Router

## Objectives

1. Install the new Netgate router
2. Configure pfsense and modify rules to secure the network
3. Install the network switch
4. Repurpose the old router as a wireless access point
